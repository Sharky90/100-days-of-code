## Log

### R1D1 
//Day 1:September 05. Thursday//
Today's Progress: I have learned about "Operators and Branching" (code structure, python boolean types and their order of operation) through MIT course Intro to CS and programming with Python.

//Day 2:September 06. Friday//
Today's Progress: Just did the 'Bindings' and 'Strings' chapter and learned how to manipulate different operations in a string.
Special thanks to MIT's intro to cs and programming with python for in detail explanation.  

//Day 3:September 07. Saturday//
Today's Progress: Learned how to control loops ( for loops & while loops) and how to break statements.

//Day 4:September 08. Sunday//
 Learned about 'Iterations' and crunched some codes using 'while' loops and 'for' loops
 
//Day 5:September 10. Tuesday//
Was coding yesterday but forgot to post...won't happen again...lol anyway I went through 'Iteration' and ' 'guess and check chapter' where I was finding a cube root of an integer. 

//Day 6:September 11. Wednesday//
Wow how many version are there with the same output?! This was a case instead of nesting a for loop inside a while loop, I had to nest a while loop inside a for loop to get same results... 

//Day 7:September 12. Thursday//
Today I've learned about 'approximate solutions' (starting with a guess and increment by some small value for some small epsilon)... The exercises are getting harder I must crunch more codes and tackle this course! üíªü§ì

//Day 8:September 13. Friday//
Ok... The left problem was the 'AHAa' moment and I was very very happy that I solved it but the right problem I've spent hours... It is supposed to be 2 ... or ?!  
Right Exercise:
s = "azcbobobegghakl"
word = "bob"
count = s.count(word)
for word in s:
      if word == 'bob':
         count += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(count))
Number of times bob occurs is: 1

Left Exercise:
count = 0 
s = "azcbobobegghakl"
for letter in s:
        if letter == 'a' or letter == 'e' or letter == 'i' or letter == 'o' or letter == 'u':
                for s in range(1):
                        count += 1
print("Number of vowels: " + str(count))
Number of vowels: 5    

//Day9: September 14.Saturday//
Ok today i learned about 'approximate solutions','bisection search'... From tomorrow I am gonna continue with "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart. 
I want to try and make some fun mini projects... 

//Day 10: September 15.Sunday//
Spent time with family but still managed to read about 'Functions' and wrote this funny exercise 'magic8ball' in python... I have to learn one more chaprer 'Lists' and then I'll be able to begin writing some fun programs...üòÅüíªü§ó

import random

def getAnswer(answerNumber):
      if answerNumber == 1:
            return 'It is certain'
      elif answerNumber == 2:
            return 'It is decidedly so'
      elif answerNumber == 3:
            return 'Yes'
      elif answerNumber == 4:
            return 'Reply hazy try again'
      elif answerNumber == 5:
            return 'Ask again later'
      elif answerNumber == 6:
            return 'Concentrate and ask again'
      elif answerNumber == 7:
            return 'My reply is no'
      elif answerNumber == 8:
            return 'Outlook not so good'
      elif answerNumber == 9:
            return 'Very doubtful'

r = random.randint(1, 9)
fortune = getAnswer(r)
print(fortune)
